| Rule testing framework | ❌ **MISSING** | No test files found in `src/test/` directory |

**Implemented Drools Rules:**
- **Volume Discount Rules**: 4 ARR-based tiers ($100K-$250K, $250K-$500K, $500K-$1M, $1M+)
- **TCV Pricing Tiers**: Multiple TCV-based pricing adjustments
- **ACV Commitment Rules**: Minimum commitment enforcement based on ACV

- Salience conflict detection
- Redundant rule identification
- Opposing effects analysis
- Health score calculation and reporting

**Critical Gap:** Rule testing framework is completely missing. No test files exist in the `src/test/` directory, which means there's no automated way to validate rule behavior.

## Critical Gap Analysis

### Missing Rule Testing Framework

**Impact:** **HIGH** - Without automated testing, rule quality and reliability cannot be guaranteed.

**What's Missing:**
```java
// Required: src/test/java/.../drools/RuleTestFramework.java
// Required: src/test/java/.../service/FinancialMetricsCalculatorTest.java
// Required: src/test/java/.../pricing/PricingStrategyTest.java
// Required: src/test/java/.../controller/FinancialMetricsControllerTest.java
```

**Required Implementation:**
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual rule execution
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete pricing scenarios
3. **Rule Validation Tests**: Verify rule syntax and logic
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure rule execution performance
5. **Conflict Detection Tests**: Validate conflict detection accuracy

### Minor Gap: Historical Metrics

**Impact:** **LOW** - Current implementation works but lacks persistence.

**Current State:**
```java
// In FinancialMetricsCalculator.java line 258
// TODO: Implement repository method with date filtering
// Return empty list for now
return List.of();
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Implement Rule Testing Framework**
   - Create comprehensive test suite for all Drools rules
   - Add unit tests for financial calculations
   - Implement integration tests for pricing scenarios
   - Add performance benchmarks for rule execution

2. **Complete Historical Metrics**
   - Implement proper repository method with date filtering
   - Add database queries for historical data retrieval
   - Test historical metrics endpoint functionality

### Enhancement Opportunities (Priority 2)
1. **Rule Performance Optimization**
   - Add rule execution metrics
   - Implement rule caching strategies
   - Optimize rule conflict detection algorithms

2. **Advanced Testing Features**
   - Add rule regression testing
   - Implement automated rule validation
   - Create rule performance benchmarks

### Testing Requirements
```java
// Example test structure needed:
@Test
public void testVolumeDiscountTier1() {
    // Test ARR $100K-$250K gets 5% discount
}

@Test
public void testChurnRiskAdjustment() {
    // Test high churn risk gets retention discount
}

@Test
public void testRuleConflictDetection() {
    // Test conflict detection accuracy
}
```
