# Product Requirements Document: Spring AI & Rules Engine Modernization

## Executive Summary

### Product Vision
Transform the price-rules-ai-drools-service into a modern, AI-orchestrated pricing platform that leverages Spring AI patterns, semantic caching, and self-consistency algorithms to deliver reliable, performant, and secure pricing decisions at scale.

### Business Objectives
1. Enable AI-augmented pricing workflows with 95% structured output success rate
2. Achieve <200ms latency improvement through semantic caching
3. Maintain zero critical security vulnerabilities
4. Deliver comprehensive observability for AI-driven pricing decisions

### Target Users
- Pricing analysts evaluating complex deals
