  "user_flow_summary": [
    "Users authenticate through JWT-based auth API to access pricing and rule management endpoints",
    "Pricing analysts submit pricing requests which are routed through AI-orchestrated workflows selecting appropriate prompts based on deal characteristics",
    "AI responses are parsed into structured Java DTOs and validated before feeding into Drools for dynamic pricing evaluations",
    "Semantic cache is checked for similarity matches to reduce AI query latency and improve performance",
    "Rule testing and conflict detection flows validate rule integrity and prevent inconsistencies before deployment",
    "Audit logs and execution histories are accessible for compliance and troubleshooting",
    "Administrators manage prompt templates, configure AI workflow parameters, and monitor system metrics through dedicated APIs and dashboards"
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "AI routing workflows correctly route requests with over 95% accuracy across test scenarios",
    "BeanOutputParser correctly converts AI JSON responses into Java DTOs without errors",
    "Semantic cache delivers >70% hit rate and reduces latency by at least 200ms in repeated query tests",
    "All critical CVEs found in dependency scans are addressed before production release",
    "Rule testing framework detects conflicts and rejects invalid rule submissions",
    "Security tests verify no web resource bypass and ensure WebDataBinder field whitelisting enforcement",
    "End-to-end integration tests validate AI-driven pricing evaluations against expected financial metrics",
    "Performance tests demonstrate system supports 1000 concurrent pricing evaluations with <500ms AI query latency",
    "Audit logs capture complete trace for AI decision processes and routing chain executions"
