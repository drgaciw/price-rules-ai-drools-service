## 3. Sequential Thinking for Rule Creation

### 3.1 Process Overview

The Sequential Thinking Engine breaks down complex rule creation into a series of logical steps:

1. **Problem Decomposition**: Break down complex pricing rules into manageable components
2. **Context Research**: Identify relevant documentation and examples
3. **Rule Formulation**: Generate rule syntax based on business requirements
4. **Validation**: Check rule for syntax errors and logical consistency
5. **Testing**: Apply test cases to verify rule behavior
6. **Refinement**: Improve rule based on feedback

### 3.2 Implementation with Sequential Thinking MCP

```javascript
// Implementation using sequential-thinking MCP
function createPricingRule(businessRequirement) {
  return sequentialThinking({
    totalThoughts: 6,
    thought: "Let's break down this pricing rule requirement into its core components",
    thoughtNumber: 1,
    nextThoughtNeeded: true,
    isRevision: false,
    needsMoreThoughts: true
  }).then(step1 => {
    return sequentialThinking({
      totalThoughts: 6,
      thought: "Based on these components, let me search for similar pricing rules in our documentation",
      thoughtNumber: 2,
      nextThoughtNeeded: true,
      isRevision: false,
      needsMoreThoughts: false
    });
  }).then(step2 => {
    return sequentialThinking({
      totalThoughts: 6,
      thought: "Now I'll formulate the rule conditions based on the business requirements and examples",
      thoughtNumber: 3,
      nextThoughtNeeded: true, 
      isRevision: false,
      needsMoreThoughts: false
    });
  }).then(step3 => {
    // Additional steps continue...
  });
}
```

### 3.3 Example Rule Creation Process

```
THOUGHT 1: Let's break down the ARR-based volume discount pricing rule requirement.
- The rule should apply discounts based on Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) thresholds
- Discount tiers are: 10% for $100K ARR, 15% for $250K ARR, 20% for $500K ARR, 25% for $1M+ ARR
- The rule should only apply to annual subscriptions
- The base price needs to be modified by the discount percentage
- The rule should document which discount tier was applied

THOUGHT 2: I'll search for similar volume discount rules in our documentation.
- Found examples of tiered discount structures in the financial services domain
- Identified pattern for progressive discount application
- Located best practices for ARR calculation and validation

THOUGHT 3: Now I'll formulate the rule conditions based on business requirements.
- Need to check if quote is for an annual subscription
- Need to calculate ARR based on monthly price * 12
- Need to determine which discount tier applies based on ARR value
- Need to apply the appropriate discount to the base price
- Need to document the applied discount for audit purposes

THOUGHT 4: Let me draft the complete rule in Drools syntax.
...
```

## 4. Context7 Integration for Documentation Retrieval

### 4.1 Documentation Retrieval Process

Context7 is used to retrieve relevant documentation and examples during rule creation and modification:

1. **Library Resolution**: Identify appropriate documentation libraries
2. **Query Formulation**: Generate contextual queries based on rule requirements
3. **Document Processing**: Extract and apply relevant patterns and examples
4. **Integration**: Incorporate documentation insights into rule creation

### 4.2 Implementation with Context7 MCP

```javascript
// Implementation using Context7 MCP
async function getDroolsDocumentation(conceptQuery) {
  // Resolve library ID for Drools documentation
  const libraryResolution = await context7_resolve_library_id({
    libraryName: "drools"
  });
  
  // Extract the appropriate library ID
  const droolsLibraryId = libraryResolution.libraries[0].id;
  
  // Retrieve documentation on the specific concept
  const documentation = await context7_get_library_docs({
    context7CompatibleLibraryID: droolsLibraryId,
    topic: conceptQuery,
    tokens: 5000
  });
  
  return documentation;
}

// Example usage
async function getVolumeDiscountExamples() {
  return await getDroolsDocumentation("volume based discount rules examples");
}
```

### 4.3 Documentation Application

```javascript
// Apply documentation insights to rule creation
async function enhanceRuleWithDocumentation(ruleContext, droolsPattern) {
  // Get documentation for pattern
  const documentation = await getDroolsDocumentation(droolsPattern);
  
  // Extract examples and best practices
  const examples = extractExamples(documentation);
  const bestPractices = extractBestPractices(documentation);
  
  // Apply to the rule context
  return {
    ...ruleContext,
    enhancedWithDocumentation: true,
    examples: examples,
    bestPractices: bestPractices,
    improvement_suggestions: generateSuggestions(ruleContext, bestPractices)
  };
}
```

## 5. Puppeteer Integration for Rule Testing and UI Automation

### 5.1 Rule Testing Process

Puppeteer enables automated testing and validation of rules through web interfaces:

1. **Environment Setup**: Configure rule testing environment
2. **Test Case Generation**: Create test scenarios based on rule logic
3. **Automated Execution**: Execute tests through web interface
4. **Result Validation**: Verify expected outcomes
5. **Visual Feedback**: Generate visual evidence of rule behavior

### 5.2 Implementation with Puppeteer MCP

```javascript
// Implementation using Puppeteer MCP
async function testDroolsRule(ruleContent, testCases) {
  // Navigate to the testing environment
  await puppeteer_navigate({
    url: "https://rule-testing-environment.example.com",
    launchOptions: { headless: false, args: ['--no-sandbox'] }
  });
  
  // Input the rule content
  await puppeteer_fill({
    selector: "#rule-content-editor",
    value: ruleContent
  });
  
  // Click the compile button
  await puppeteer_click({
    selector: "#compile-button"
  });
  
  // Wait for compilation to complete
  await puppeteer_evaluate({
    script: `
      return new Promise(resolve => {
        const checkCompileStatus = () => {
          const status = document.querySelector('#compile-status').textContent;
          if (status !== 'Compiling...') {
            resolve(status);
          } else {
            setTimeout(checkCompileStatus, 500);
          }
        };
        checkCompileStatus();
      });
    `
  });
  
  // Run test cases
  const results = [];
  for (const testCase of testCases) {
    // Configure test inputs
    await puppeteer_fill({
      selector: "#test-input",
      value: JSON.stringify(testCase.input)
    });
    
    // Execute test
    await puppeteer_click({
      selector: "#execute-test"
    });
    
    // Capture result
    const result = await puppeteer_evaluate({
      script: `
        return document.querySelector('#test-output').textContent;
      `
    });
    
    // Take screenshot of results
    await puppeteer_screenshot({
      selector: "#results-panel",
      name: `test-case-${testCase.id}`
    });
    
    results.push({
      testCase: testCase,
      result: JSON.parse(result),
      success: JSON.parse(result).price === testCase.expectedOutput.price
    });
  }
  
  return results;
}
```

### 5.3 Example Test Case

```javascript
// Example test case for ARR-based volume discount
const testCase = {
  id: "TC001",
  name: "Enterprise customer with $500K ARR",
  input: {
    customerType: "ENTERPRISE",
    subscriptionType: "ANNUAL",
    monthlyPrice: 41667, // $500K ARR
    durationInMonths: 12,
    basePrice: 500000
  },
  expectedOutput: {
    finalPrice: 400000, // 20% discount applied
    discountRate: 0.20,
    discountTier: "$500K ARR"
  }
};
```

      when
        ${ruleFormulation.conditions.join("\n        ")}
      then
